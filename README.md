üöÄ React + Spring Boot CRUD Operations
This project demonstrates basic CRUD operations using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend.

üîß Backend Deployment (Spring Boot + MySQL on Google Cloud)
The backend is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

MySQL is used as the database for storing and managing data.

The .jar file was uploaded on June 11, 2025.

Google Cloud provides a free trial for 91 days or $300 in credits.

‚ö†Ô∏è The backend service will stop once the free trial ends.

üìå Purpose
This project is created for practice purposes only.
After completing this project, I plan to:

Learn JWT (JSON Web Token) for session management.

Integrate Spring Security with JWT to secure the application.
